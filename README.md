This repository contains tools to use NTK Photonics devices, including SuperK COMPACT laser and SuperK SELECT tunable filter. Python functions for easy use are found in [controls.py](controls.py). Example usage is shown in [Laser_Demo.ipynb](Laser_Demo.ipynb). 

For Python contols of other devices, see [nkt-tools](https://pypi.org/project/nkt-tools/), which documents NKT Extreme/Fianium lasers and the Varia system. (Maybe we make a pull request to update additional devices?)
